# Intelligent-Object-Detection-and-Adaptive-Navigation-for-Autonomous-Vehicles-using-Machine-Learning
The project strives to achieve superior accuracy, speed, and robustness in pedestrian detection and intent forecasting by leveraging a combination of deep learning models, including YOLO, Faster R-CNN, and HOG + SVM.
In many economically challenged regions, the intricacies of road conditions present formidable challenges for existing self-driving car models. These models often struggle to adapt to diverse variables such as pose, scale, illumination, and background variations, limiting their applicability to various scenarios. Recognizing the pressing need for improvements, this project seeks to advance current models by incorporating additional variables, enabling them to make more accurate predictions.
The emergence of self-driving vehicles holds immense potential for elevating transportation safety, efficiency, and convenience. However, these vehicles encounter substantial hurdles, particularly in the realms of object detection and intelligent decision-making within intricate and dynamic road environments. This project endeavors to pioneer an innovative system capable of proficiently identifying objects, animals, and pedestrians on the road. Its ultimate goal is to facilitate intelligent decision-making for safe and effective navigation in diverse scenarios, such as encountering vehicles with specific speeds or unforeseen obstacles like a flying ball approaching the vehicle.
Crucially, this project is tailored to the unique challenges posed by Indian traffic and infrastructure, which often differ significantly from those in other countries. The focus lies on comprehensive model training to address the complexities of Indian scenarios, where current benchmarks may fall short, leading to errors and misjudgments. The project's primary emphasis is on augmenting holistic object detection and informed decision-making capabilities for self-driving vehicles, recognizing the necessity for a more calibrated approach in the vast and varied landscape of Indian road scenarios.
